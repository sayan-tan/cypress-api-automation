```

- `cypress/e2e`: Contains the actual test files. You can organize your tests into subdirectories as needed. 
- `cypress/fixtures`: Contains external files (example: user create/update data) that can be used to mock data during tests.
- `cypress/reports`: Contains the report for tests (Logs are attached).
- `cypress/support`: Contains custom commands and global configuration.
- `cypress/support/utils`: Contains the Utilities that provides methods for asserting different conditions on web elements, handling requests and responses.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- Modify `cypress.config.json` for Cypress configuration settings.
- Customize `commands.js` and other files in `cypress/support` for reusable commands.

## üîÑ Continuous Integration

This project is configured for CI using Github Actions. Check the configurations in `.github/workflows/*.yml`.

- `01_api_tests.yml`: This workflow executes tests in pre-defined environment PROD.
- `02_api_tests_select_env.yml`: This workflow will first ask User to select the environment (DEV / Pre-PROD / PROD) for tests execution.

## üìä Reporting

Mochawesome report (Logs are attached) is stored in the `cypress/reports` directory.
